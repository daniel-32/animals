IMPORTANT NOTICE: This mod is currently undergoing a major rewrite. At present
it is not particularly usable and is likely to be incompatible with any animal
mods that you may be using. Installing this mod as it currently stands is
likely to break your game. The last version that you should use is commit
#93c50b5b71487158be5d536ffe93beca6dd34428.

This mod provides a framework for easily creating new animals for Minetest.
The mod is aimed towards farm/domestic animals. Animals can be tamed and bred.
A tamed animal can only be interacted with or bred by its owner.

Animals are installed via additional mods. Please consult the documentation
accompanying each animal mod for specific details.

NOTE: This mod is not, and makes no attempt to be, compatible with mods
intended for use with or worlds containing items from Creatures MOB-Engine.
